# My ESPHome Examples
This repo just contains my ESPHome related project files.

## Home Sensors
My first ESPHome projects are centered around a board that I am using to various ESPHome based sensors.

This board is available on PCBWay from this page: https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Home_Sensor_Board.html. You can order boards for yourself from PCBWay directly. The PCB project page has most of the components listed (the ones I purchased from Aliexpress).

You can also watch this video is you need more info on how it is designed:

## ESPHome standalone in Windows
If you want to use EPSHome without Home Assistant, I have covered that setup in a separate video:

My initial set of project will be used with Node-Red and ESPHome set up to communicate with MQTT. For Home Assistant you can just remove the MQTT related lines and you can use the sensor for Home Assistant.

## Living Room Sensor
This sensor will be mainly an environment sensor for the living room of my holiday home. It will be moniting temperature, humidity and pressure, and also include a radar motion sensor. The sensor is mains powered.
